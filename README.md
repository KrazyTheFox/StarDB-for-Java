# StarDB

A port of the Python library for manipulating Starbound database files to Java.
The code is loosely based on [yuedb](https://bitbucket.org/kyren/yuedb), which 
is written by one of the Starbound developers and is what the DB code in the 
game is based on as well.

Currently StarDB only supports read operations, but write operations may be 
added in the future.

## Usage

Coming soon!

## Current Issues

Doesn't quite work yet. :P
